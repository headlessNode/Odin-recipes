        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Tandoori chicken is a South Asian dish of chicken 
            marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor,
             a cylindrical clay oven. 
             Tandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetizer, 
             or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread.
             It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, 
             such as butter chicken.

            <li>1 teaspoon red food coloring (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring (optional)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish.
                 Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.
            </li> 

            <li>
                Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.
                 Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
            </li>

            <li>
                When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
                 Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear.
                 An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.
            </li>
        </ol>
