        <p>
            Gulab jamun 'Rose water berry' is a sweet confectionery 
            or dessert originating in the Indian subcontinent.
            It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, 
            which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. 
            Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead 
            of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts 
            such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, 
                and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 
                <em>5 to 10 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl 
                until well-combined. 
                Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes 
                together. Let gulab dough rest for <em>5 minutes</em>. 
                Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 
                <em>350 degrees F </em> (175 degrees C). 
                Test the temperature of the oil by 
                dropping in a small piece of dough. 
                When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 
                <em>1 minute</em> before coming to the surface, 
                the oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Fry <em>4 gulab balls</em> at a time, 
                stirring carefully, until dark golden brown 
                on all sides, about <em>2 minutes</em>. 
                Drain on a paper-towel lined plate. 
                Repeat with remaining gulab.</li>
            <li>Bring syrup back up to a boil and 
                drop in fried gulab. 
                Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup,
                 covered, <em>45 minutes to 1 hour</em>.</li>
        </ol>
