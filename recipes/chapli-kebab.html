        <p>
            Chapli kebab is a minced meat patty widely popular in Pakistan. 
            Mixed with a blend of spices, ground beef is flattened into patties 
            and shallow-fried until the exterior is charred and flavorful. 
            Serve in a bun with pickled red onions 
            or with a side of pita bread.
